Premier League & NFL- could scrape data from https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/history/Premier-League-Seasons and football-reference for all relevent data, package into CSV and put into database... but that's a lot. hopefully something easier







Sportradar API can be used to track games in real time, possibly displaying them somewhere in the webpage when doing trivia or other minigames? possibly paid :(

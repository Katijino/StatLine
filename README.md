Statline
September 2024
Overview

StatLine is a solo project created for the purpose of providing more advanced statistical questions for Sporting daily games. Games like Poeltl and Crossover provide users with daily games for sport, asking you to guess the player or pick the top 5 of some certain stat, in order. The various daily sport games provide users with isolated, unoptimized experiences that, if combined into one large platform, could draw a much larger user count than the sum of each.

StatLine will provide a more intuitive UI than other daily sports games, allowing for users to play a multitude of daily sports games all in one place. The application will use data pulled from various sport websites and databases to curate current, interesting, and unique daily sport trivia questions for the NFL, NBA, and European Soccer Leagues to start. 

The stack for StatLine will be React for the frontend development, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database to store all pertinent data. I also plan to use data pulled from the various sporting sites to create interesting statistics using Machine Learning.
Semester Goals
This project is a very undeveloped and unresearched thought that I wanted to bring into life, so the first portion of the semester is set aside for finding good, solid data and learning how to use the various items on the tech stack I'm unfamiliar with. After that, I plan to create daily basketball trivia games,  pertaining to various daily games created by myself and other creators on the internet. The rest of the semester will be dedicated to improving the UI for the games and possibly developing other sport trivia as well. If time permits, my final goal for the semester is to develop a system for users to login and save a streak on the website, with possible badges or achievements.

Milestones:

End of September

Find reputable and understandable data for NBA, NFL, and European Soccer leagues and parse it into a MongoDB backend.

End of October

Have the frontend UI setup, having at least 1-2 daily games with a sample question for each.

Mid November

Connect the frontend to the backend, connecting the trivia UI to the actual data to present a new and unique question every day

End of November

Use the data given in the statistics pulled to generate interesting questions daily and possibly create new statistics to interest users.

End of Semester

Store questions from previous days and allow users to go back through and answer previous statistical trivia questions whenever.
